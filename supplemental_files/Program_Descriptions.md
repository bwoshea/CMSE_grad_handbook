# Program descriptions

This is intended to provide brief descriptions of each degree/certificate/etc.

### Graduate certificate in Computational Modeling  

The Graduate Certificate in Computational Modeling is intended for students with little or no prior programming or computational modeling experience. The purpose of this certificate is to complement graduate students' degree programs with a set of courses that teach students critical skills in computer programming, data manipulation and visualization, and computational modeling.  Students that have completed this certificate will be able to: 
 
* Demonstrate a basic understanding of functional computer programming as applied to a range of problems in computational and data science.  
* Analyze problems in terms of the algorithms and pre-existing computational tools required to solve a range of problems in computational and data science, and write a program to efficiently solve the problem.  * Construct and implement models and simulations of physical, biological, and social situations, and use these models/simulations to understand experimental or observational data.  
* Apply some subset of discipline-focused or methodology-focused topics in computational and data science to solve problems in the student’s primary discipline.

### Graduate certificate in High Performance Computing  

The Graduate Certificate in High Performance Computing is intended for graduate students in any discipline who have significant prior computational experience.  The purpose of this certificate is to completment students' degree programs with a set of courses that provide students with a broad exposure to parallel computing methodology, and give them experience with computational and data science challenges that require parallel and/or high-performance computing in order to solve effectively.
 Students that have completed this certificate will be able to:
* Demonstrate a high-level understanding of functional and object-oriented computer programming as applied to a range of problems in computational and data science.
* Analyze problems in terms of the algorithms and pre-existing computational tools required to solve a range of problems in computational and data science, and write a program to efficiently solve the problem on modern parallel computers and specialized hardware (e.g., graphics processing units).
* Construct and implement models of a variety of systems using modern parallel programming techniques and software development techniques, and use these models/simulations to gain understanding of these systems.
* Apply some subset of discipline-focused or methodology-focused topics in computational and data science to solve problems in the student’s primary discipline.
### Master of Science in CMSE  

The overall goal of the M.S. in CMSE is to give students broad and deep knowledge of the fundamental techniques used in computational modeling and data science, as well as significant exposure to at least one application domain.  Students that have completed this M.S. program will be able to:

* Analyze problems in terms of the algorithms and pre-existing computational tools required to solve a range of problems in computational and data science, and write programs to efficiently solve the problem using cutting-edge computational hardware.  * Construct and implement models and simulations of physical, biological, and social situations, and use these models/simulations to understand experimental or observational data.  * Apply discipline-focused or methodology-focused topics in computational and data science to solve problems in the student’s application domain of choice.

### Doctor of Philosophy in CMSE  

The overall goal of the PhD program in Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering is to give students broad and deep knowledge of the fundamental techniques used in computational modeling and data science, significant exposure to at least one application domain, and to conduct significant original research in algorithms and/or applications relating to computational and data science.  Students that have completed this PhD program will be able to:

* Analyze problems in terms of the algorithms and pre-existing computational tools required to solve a range of problems in computational and data science, and write programs to efficiently solve the problem using cutting-edge computational hardware.  * Construct and implement models and simulations of physical, biological, and social situations, and use these models/simulations to understand experimental or observational data.  * Apply discipline-focused or methodology-focused topics in computational and data science to solve problems in the student’s application domain of choice.
* Conduct significant original research and present it in peer-reviewed articles, a written dissertation, and orally in a variety of venues.  * **OTHER THINGS HERE?**
