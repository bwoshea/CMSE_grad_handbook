# Admission requirements

This section describes the admission requirements for the graduate certificates and degrees offered by the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering.  Any additional questions can be addressed to the [CMSE Director of Graduate Studies](mailto:fill@this.in).

### Graduate certificates in Computational Modeling and High Performance Computing

Virtually any graduate student at Michigan State University may pursue the Graduate Certificates in Computational Modeling and High Performance Computing; there is no additional application required to pursue the certificate.  However, a student must have a 3.0 grade-point average in all of the courses applying to the certificate at the time they apply to receive their degree.

Graduate students pursuing either the Master of Science in CMSE or the Doctor of Philosophy in CMSE may not also receive a graduate certificate in Computational Modeling or High Performance Computing.

### Master of Science in CMSE  

At present, admission directly to the Master of Science degree is only available in exceptional circumstances.  The admissions criteria are identical to those of the CMSE PhD program, as described below.

### Doctor of Philosophy in CMSE  

Students who wish to apply to the doctoral program in Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering should, at the time of entering the program, have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or any science or engineering field.  Beyond this requirement, a student should have:

* Coursework in calculus through differential equations
* A course in basic linear algebra or equivalent training through a related course.
* Competency in basic statistics through coursework or practical experience
* Competency in at least one commonly-used programming language (e.g., Python, C/C++, Java, etc.)

The competitive student will also have some experience outside of their coursework in scientific computing or data science that demonstrates their aptitude for success in a PhD program.  This experience could include, but is not limited to:  

* Undergraduate research experience with a strong computational component, possibly in an REU program or working directly with an individual faculty member at their home institution
* An internship at a national laboratory or company working on a project that has a significant computational modeling and/or data science focus.
* Independent contributions to open-source programs or libraries, particularly with a computational modeling and/or data science focus.

Applications to the PhD program in Computational Science and Engineering must include:

1. Official transcripts for all prior undergraduate or graduate degrees and coursework
2. A resume or CV
3. A research statement **of no more than two pages in length** describing:  
  a. The applicant's prior programming, computational, and research experience;  
  b. The applicant's goals in pursuing a PhD in CMSE;  
  c. The CMSE faculty with whom an applicant may be interested in pursuing their dissertation research.  
4. At least three letters of recommendation that address the applicant's past accomplishments and potential for success in pursuing independent research in computational and/or data science.
