# CMSE PhD requirements

Students pursuing a PhD in CMSE must:

1.  Demonstrate proficiency in the following four areas: Mathematical Foundations of Data Science, Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, Parallel Programming, and Numerical Linear Algebra.  Proficiency is demonstrated by passing the qualifying exam, which consists of separate subject exams in each of these topics.  Students typically enroll in the four core CMSE courses that provide instruction in these subject areas (CMSE 820-823; 12 credits total).  The four subject exams must be passed with an average grade of 3.5 and no exam having a grade below 3.0.
2. Complete a minimum of 18 additional credits in coursework chosen in consultation with, and approved by, the studentâ€™s dissertation committee.  (Students must take a minimum of 30 credit hours of non-research-based coursework beyond the Bachelor's level.)  No more than 6 credits of this coursework can be below the 800 level (and all such coursework is allowable only with approval of the Graduate Director), and none of this coursework can be below the 400 level.
3. Complete a minimum of 24, and maximum of 36, dissertation research credits (CMSE 999).4. Pass a comprehensive examination with both written and oral components at least six months before the defense of their dissertation.
5. Meet annually with their dissertation committee to report on progress and receive guidance.  This annual meeting must include a written annual report.5. Complete and orally defend a dissertation based on original research in algorithms pertaining to, and/or applications of, computational and/or data science.  6. All PhD students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research Training.  

Each of these requirements is described in more detail below.

## Core course requirement

The purpose of the four core courses (in numerical linear algebra, numerical differential equations, parallel computing, and the mathematical foundations of data science) is to provide CMSE PhD students with a broad and deep understanding of the fundamental algorithms pertaining to computational and data science.

A student with no deficiencies in their mathematics or programming background should complete all four core courses during the first year of their PhD (where "completion" assumes passage of the subject exams; see below); at the latest, all four core courses should be completed by the end of their 2nd year.  Students can demonstrate proficiency in one or more of these core courses, and thus be excused from taking said course(s), by taking the subject exam and receiving a passing grade (see the "Qualifying Examination" section for more details).  Students who demonstrate proficiency in this way are still required to meet the minimum course credit requirement for the degree (30 credits beyond the Bachelor's degree).

## Qualifying examination

The qualifying examination in CMSE is composed of four subject exams, corresponding to the four core CMSE courses (CMSE 820-823). This requirement is intended to ensure that all students receiving a CMSE PhD achieve an acceptable level of expertise in the core numerical algorithms pertaining to computational and data science.  

Each subject exam will be offered twice per academic year.  All four exams will be offered immediately prior to the start of the fall semester, and each subject exam will be offered again as the final exam of the corresponding core CMSE course (parallel programming and numerical linear algebra in the fall; numerical differential equations and the mathematical foundations of data science in the spring).

Students will be given three opportunities to pass each subject exam, and must pass all four subject exams by the end of their second year in the PhD program.  Students beginning the PhD program in the fall term may, but are not required to, take one or more subject exams immediately upon arrival at MSU.  Assuming no deficiencies, all students must take the subject exams the first time they are offered after the beginning of their first semester in the PhD program (i.e., as the final exam of the corresponding core course for students entering in the fall).  Students starting the PhD program in the spring term will not have an option to take subject exams prior to the start of the spring semester; rather, they must take the subject exams for the first time at the end of the semester where each core course is offered.

The subject exams will cover a set of topics set forth by the Department, which will be provided to the students in advance of the exams. The subject exams will be created and graded by a committee of CMSE faculty that must include the current or most recent instructor of that course.  The purpose of the committee is to ensure consistency in topical coverage and level of difficulty between instructors and exam offerings.  Subject exams may include a practical (i.e., programming) component.  Passage of all four subject exams with a minimum average exam grade of 3.5 and no exam grade below 3.0 constitutes passage of the qualifying exam requirement for the department.

It is possible that a student has already taken graduate coursework, or obtained equivalent practical experience, in one or more subjects that correspond to the four course CMSE graduate courses.  Such a student may be excused from taking that course by demonstrating proficiency in the material by passing the appropriate subject exam, with the requirements for passage being the same as for students who choose to enroll in the course.  In this case, students must still meet the course credit requirement of 30 credits past the bachelor's degree by taking other courses.

## Cognate course requirement

The purpose of the cognate requirement is to give students in-depth expertise in one or more subject areas that are complementary to the core curriculum and which pertain to their research interests, to provide in-depth exposure to one or more areas of numerical methodology, to develop expertise in an additional area of computational or data science, and/or to fill gaps in a student's undergraduate education.

The cognate coursework must be chosen by the student in consultation with their dissertation committee (or the Director of Graduate Studies, if the student has not yet formed their dissertation committee), and must include at least 12 credits of coherent coursework addressing a single general topic or subject area.  This cognate can be in any subject area, including an application area, mathematics, statistics, or computer science.  A minimum GPA of 3.0 is expected in the cognate area, and no more than 6 credits can be below the 800 level (with no credits below the 400 level).

## Comprehensive examination

There are several goals of the comprehensive examination in the CMSE PhD program.  This examination enables students:

1. To demonstrate mastery of the current state-of-the-art in their chosen area of specialization, as defined by the current body of literature in that field.
2. To demonstrate their ability to communicate scientific goals, methods, and results in written and oral form. 
3. To demonstrate the ability to construct a realistic and detailed plan of research for their dissertation.

The comprehensive exam is also the first opportunity for students to receive formal feedback from their thesis committee.

**Timing:** Students should plan to complete the comprehensive examination component of their PhD requirements within two years of beginning the PhD program, and no later than the end of their third year in the program.  In addition, this requirement must be completed no less than six months prior to defending their dissertation. 

**Examination components:**  The comprehensive examination has two components: a written project proposal and an oral presentation.

The written project proposal should be approximately 10-15 pages long, and should include the following elements:

* A literature survey describing the current state of their chosen area of specialization.
* A summary of the research that the student has done so far, which should form the beginning of their dissertation research.
* A proposal for the rest of their thesis research, including:
  * The scientific motivation for this work
  * The specifics of the project(s) that will be undertaken
  * A timeline for completion of this work.
* A brief description of their post-PhD career goals and a description of the types of professional development opportunities that they will pursue to facilitate these goals.  Such opportunities may include, but are not limited to, specific types of training (in written and/or oral communication, team skills, particular research methods, etc.), internships, acting as a mentor, or going to conferences or workshops in particular subject areas.

The written document must be sent to the thesis committee at least two weeks (10 business days) prior to their first thesis committee meeting.  The first thesis committee meeting is open to the public, and contains the following elements:

* A presentation covering the first three aspects of the written proposal, which should be approximately 45 minutes long and in the style of a research seminar.
* A public question and answer period moderated by the chairperson of the thesis committee, which should be no longer than fifteen minutes long.  Members of the audience are allowed to ask questions; the thesis committee should remain silent during this period.
* A private question and answer period comprised of only the student and their thesis committee.  The main goals of this questioning are to determine the soundness and feasibility of the student's dissertation research, to ensure that the student understands the broader context within which their work is being done, and to determine the practicality of the student's professional development plan.  The committee is also expected to provide constructive feedback about all aspects of the student's written and oral presentations.

The possible outcomes of the comprehensive exam are:

* **Pass without qualification:** The student has successfully demonstrated all three of the goals described at the beginning of this section.
* **Pass with qualification:** The student has successfully demonstrated some of the goals described at the beginning of this section, but has been found to be deficient in one of them.  
* **Fail:** The student has significant deficiencies in one or more of the goals described at the beginning of this section.

If a student passes *without* qualification, they have formally passed their comprehensive examination requirement and no further action is needed on their part.

If a student passes *with* qualification, the thesis committee may specify that the student take action to remediate the observed deficiency.  Such actions may include, but are not limited to, extra practice with written and/or oral presentations; additional coursework; additional reading of the literature, possibly with a formal requirement to summarize their reading in written form for the committee; or a revised research plan or professional development plan.  This outcome does not require an additional committee meeting; instead, the thesis advisor is responsible for ensuring that the student undertakes any remedial actions, and will report on this to the thesis committee at the next meeting.

If a student fails the comprehensive examination, their dissertation committee will provide them with formal written feedback on the outcome of this meeting, which will include specific suggestions on how they can improve their performance in the future.  They may retake the comprehensive examination within six months, and if they fail a second time they will not be allowed to continue in the PhD program.


## Doctoral Dissertation

### PhD dissertation committee

The student's thesis committee should be formed by the end of the summer following their first academic year in the PhD program, and *must* be formed no later than the end of their fourth semester in the program. At its early stages, this committee is primarily intended to guide students in their choice of coursework; at later stages of a student's PhD program they administer the comprehensive exam (as the student's first formal thesis committee meeting) and monitor the progress of the thesis.  

A student's dissertation committee is composed of a minimum of four  members with the following requirements (beyond the [MSU graduate college requirements](https://hr.msu.edu/documents/facacadhandbooks/facultyhandbook/composition.htm)):

* At least two members of the committee must be Michigan State University faculty members with a non-0% appointment in CMSE, one of whom must be primiarily in CMSE (i.e., CMSE must be their tenure home).
* One committee member *must* be a MSU faculty whose appointment is entirely outside of CMSE (i.e., may not have any appointment in CMSE, including a 0% appointment).

Members of external institutions or non-tenure stream faculty or academic specialists may participate in a thesis committee in an official capacity as one of the four required faculty members or as the chairperson of a doctoral student's guidance committee, but only if an exception is granted by the Dean of The Graduate School.   The majority of committee members must, however, be tenure-stream MSU faculty.

The student must meet with their thesis committee on an annual basis to present on their progress and to report on it to the CMSE graduate director and the Graduate College, and must display satisfactory progress every year.  If the student does not display satisfactory progress, the thesis committee should meet on a more rapid cadence to monitor and report on their progress.  If a student is deemed by the thesis committee to have made unsatisfactory progress for two thesis committee meetings in a row, they will not be allowed to continue in the PhD program.

### Dissertation and dissertation defense

The student's dissertation must be composed of novel research that advances the state-of-the-art in algorithms or applications relating to computational and/or data science.

A student's PhD dissertation must conform to MSU formatting standards (a LaTeX template is available), and should be submitted to the entire thesis committee no less than two weeks (10 business days) prior to their dissertation defense.  The thesis will also be available for viewing to the entire department electronically.

The thesis defense is an oral defense that has the following components:

* An oral presentation, open to the public, where the student presents background material and the key findings of their dissertation in the style of a research seminar.  This presentation should be approximately 45 minutes long, and does not need to comprehensively cover the student's dissertation results (i.e., a student can choose to focus on some subset of topics from their dissertation if they choose).
* A public question and answer period following their oral presentation, wherein the student answers questions posed by non-committee members.  The chair of the thesis committee may moderate these questions and is encouraged to limit them to no more than an additional half hour.
* A private session where the student answers questions from the committee regarding their dissertation research.  At the committee's discretion, they may also question the student about the fundamentals of the algorithms or application area relating to the student's dissertation research.

The possible outcomes of the presentation of the disssertation and oral defense can be:

* **Pass with no revisions.**  The dissertation and oral defense both meet or exceed the standards for quality and original research expected of students in the CMSE program, and the thesis committee needs no changes to be made to the dissertation.  The student may immediately deposit their thesis with the Graduate College.
* **Pass with minor revisions.**  The dissertation and oral defense both meet or exceed the standards  for quality and original research expected of students in the CMSE program, but the thesis committee deems minor changes to be made to the dissertation document (e.g., typos corrected, the addition of small amounts of clarifying text, etc.).  A written list of the requested changes will be created by the thesis committee and presented to the student, who then must make changes to their dissertation as necessary.  The student's dissertation advisor(s) will make the final decision about acceptance of the written dissertation.  Following acceptance by the advisor, the student may deposit their thesis with the Graduate College.
* **Pass with major revisions.**  The dissertation and oral defense both meet the standards for quality and original research expected of students in the CMSE program, but the thesis committee deems major revisions must be made to the dissertation.  In this context, "major changes" mean the addition or removal of significant amounts of text or pursuing additional research/(re-)analysis and adding that to the dissertation document.  A written list of the requested changes will be created by the thesis committee and presented to the student, who then must make changes to their dissertation as necessary.  After the student has provided the entire thesis committee with a revised version of their thesis (within a reasonable period of time), the thesis must be accepted by a majority of members of the thesis committee.  Following acceptance by the majority of the thesis committee, the student may deposit their thesis with the Graduate College.
* **Failure.** The dissertation and/or oral defense have one or more irredeemable flaws and the majority of the thesis committee agrees that an acceptable level of quality cannot be obtained in a reasonable length of time, then the dissertation will be rejected and the student will be removed from the PhD program.

## Responsible Conduct of Research Training

All PhD students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research Training to fulfill the requirements specified by the [Graduate School](grad.msu.edu/rcr/), which addresses requirements regarding graduate training from the National Science Foundation and National Institute of Health, among other federal agencies.  This training can include online training offered by the [College of Engineering](https://www.egr.msu.edu/secureresearchcourses/) or one of any number of in-person training sessions.
