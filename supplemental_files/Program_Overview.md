# Program overview

The use of computational methods and tools to solve important problems is a fact of life in the 21st century in the sciences, engineering, and many other fields.  Knowledge of how these methods work, and how to use them effectively, has become crucial to the success of students entering these fields.

To that end, Michigan State University's Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (CMSE) has developed several curricula at the graduate level that are intended to provide MSU students with the computational skills that they need to thrive in the 21st century workforce.  Broadly speaking, this includes:

* The ability to visualize and explore large quantities of data to find important relations and trends (i.e., 'data science' and/or 'big data')
* The ability to create and implement as software models to explain and explore a wide variety of systems and situations
* The ability to effectively use modern computational hardware, including cloud computing, massively parallel supercomputers, and hardware accelerators.

MSU students have a wide variety of needs with regards to computational and data science, which may range from taking a single course on computational modeling or numerical methods through completing a PhD in scientific computing or data science.  This document provides details about the courses and curricula available through the Department of Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering.
