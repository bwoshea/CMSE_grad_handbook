## Non-CMSE computational and data-science courses

Note: this list contains courses that have been pre-screened and will automatically be accepted for the CMSE graduate certificates and degrees (modulo limits described in the individual program descriptions).  Please note that other computationally-focused MSU courses may also be acceptable for these programs!  Consult departmental listings in the [MSU course catalog](http://reg.msu.edu/Courses) for the most timely information about appropriate courses, and email the [CMSE Director of Graduate Studies](mailto:fill@this.in) if you have questions about courses that may count toward a CMSE graduate certificate or degree.
