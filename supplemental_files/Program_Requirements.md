# Program requirements

This section should lay out what the requirements of each degree or curriculum should be in detail, including courses, etc.


## Graduate certificate in Computational Modeling  

The Graduate Certificate in Computational Modeling consists of at least three courses comprising a minimum of 9 credit hours, taken from the two categories listed below.  The targets of the certificate program are graduate students in any discipline with interest in applying computational and data science approaches to their research problems, or who generally desire a broad education in computational modeling and computational methodology.  To facilitate this goal, in addition to there being no restriction on graduate student discipline, students can apply for the certificate at any time prior to receiving their degree (either Master’s or PhD), and can apply for the certificate after taking all the necessary courses. 1. Any two of the CMSE core graduate courses (6 credits):      * CMSE-801, Introduction to Computational Modeling (3 credits)
    * CMSE-802, Methods in Computational Modeling (3 credits)      * CMSE-820, Mathematical Foundations of Data Science (3 credits)  
    * CMSE-821, Numerical methods for differential equations    * CMSE/CSE-822, Parallel programming (3 credits) 
    * CMSE-823, Numerical Linear Algebra, I (3 credits)

2.  One or more additional courses, which may include further CMSE courses at the 400 level or above (including from the list of core CMSE graduate courses in List 1), courses from the list of non-CMSE courses [found here](./Course_Descriptions.html), or other computational science or data science-focused courses at the 400 level or above as approved by the CMSE graduate advisor (3 or more credits).

**Note:** In order to obtain this graduate certificate the student must have at least a 3.0 average in the courses that are applied to the certificate.


## Graduate certificate in High Performance Computing  

The proposed Graduate Certificate in High Performance Computing consists of at least three courses comprising a minimum of 9 credit hours, taken from the two categories listed below. The targets of the certificate program are graduate students in any discipline with interest in applying computational and data science approaches that require parallel and/or high-performance computing to their research problems, or who generally desire an education in parallel computational methodology. To facilitate this goal, in addition to there being no restriction on graduate student discipline, students can apply for the certificate at any time prior to receiving their degree (either Master’s or PhD), and can apply for the certificate after taking all the necessary courses.
Note that credit from courses whose focus is largely or primarily an introduction to programming and/or basic numerical methods (i.e., CMSE 801, CMSE 802, CSE 801, or other comparable courses) **will not count for credit** toward this certificate. In addition, 400-level computational coursework may not count for credit toward this certificate without the permission of the CMSE graduate certificate advisor. The primary circumstance where a 400-level course may be acceptable for credit toward this certificate program is when an equivalent 800-level course is unavailable (e.g., a highly specialized 400-level combined undergraduate and graduate course.) Students that have questions about any particular course are strongly encouraged to consult the CMSE graduate certificate advisor.

Categories of courses:

1. CMSE/CSE-822, Parallel Computing (3 credits)  
2. Two or more additional courses, which may include further CMSE courses at the 800 level or above, courses from the list of non-CMSE courses [found here](./Course_Descriptions.html), or any other 800- or 900-level computational science or data science-focused courses as approved by the CMSE graduate advisor (6 or more credits).

**Note:** In order to obtain this graduate certificate the student must have at least a 3.0 average in the courses that are applied to the certificate.


## Master of Science in CMSE  

Students pursuing a M.S. in CMSE must complete a minimum of 30 credits of graduate coursework, at least 18 credits of which must be CMSE courses. There are two possible 'tracks' in the program: Plan A, which includes a thesis, or Plan B, which does not have a thesis. The student’s program of study must be approved by the student’s guidance committee. The student must meet the requirements specified below:
**Common Requirements for Plan A and Plan B:**  1. Complete a minimum of three of the following four core CMSE courses **with an average grade of at least 3.3 on the corresponding subject exams and no grade lower than 3.0** (at least 9 credits):
    * CMSE 820, Mathematical Foundations of Data Science (3 credits)  
    * CMSE 821, Numerical Methods for Differential Equations (3 credits)  
    * CMSE/CSE 822, Parallel Programming (3 credits)  
    * CMSE 823, Numerical Linear Algebra, I (3 credits)  
2. Complete a minimum of 12 credits in complementary coursework chosen in consultation with, and approved by, the student’s academic advisor.  
3. All M.S. students must complete Responsible Conduct of Research Training.**Additional Requirements for Plan A:** In addition to requirements 1-4 above, the student must complete a thesis based on original research on a problem in computational and/or data science. The student will enroll in a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 8 credits of CMSE 899 (Master’s Thesis Research). This thesis research will culminate in a written thesis to be submitted to, and accepted by, a guidance committee. Part of the acceptance process may include an oral examination of the student’s work.
**Additional Requirements for Plan B:** Requirements 1-4 will apply. In lieu of pursuing original research in computational and/or data science, the student will enroll in additional coursework. This coursework may include up to 3 credits of CMSE 891 (Independent Study) if approved by the student’s academic advisor. There is no requirement for either a written thesis or oral presentation.
