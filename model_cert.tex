\subsection{Graduate Certificate in Computational Modeling}
\label{sec:cert_model}

\subsubsection{Certificate description}

The Graduate Certificate in Computational Modeling is intended for
students with little or no prior programming or computational modeling
experience. The purpose of this certificate is to complement graduate
students' degree programs with a set of courses that teach students
critical skills in computer programming, data manipulation and
visualization, and computational modeling.  

\textbf{This is a transcriptable
certificate, meaning that the certificate name will show up on a
student's transcript in addition to the courses that were taken.}

\noindent
Students that have completed this certificate will be able to: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item  Demonstrate a basic understanding of functional computer
  programming as applied to a range of problems in computational and
  data science.  

\item  Analyze problems in terms of the algorithms and pre-existing
  computational tools required to solve a range of problems in
  computational and data science, and write a program to efficiently
  solve the problem.  

\item  Construct and implement models and simulations of physical,
  biological, and social situations, and use these models/simulations
  to understand experimental or observational data.  

\item  Apply some subset of discipline-focused or methodology-focused
topics in computational and data science to solve problems in the
student's primary discipline.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Certificate requirements}

The Graduate Certificate in Computational Modeling consists of at least
three courses comprising a minimum of 9 credit hours, taken from the
two categories listed below.  This certificate program is intended for
graduate students in any discipline with interest in applying
computational and data science approaches to their research problems,
or who generally desire a broad education in computational modeling
and computational methodology.

\noindent
The requirements for the certificate are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Any two of following CMSE graduate courses (6 credits):  

\begin{itemize}
    \item  CMSE-801, Introduction to Computational Modeling (3 credits)
    \item  CMSE-802, Methods in Computational Modeling (3 credits)  
    \item  CMSE-820, Mathematical Foundations of Data Science (3 credits)  
    \item  CMSE-821, Numerical methods for differential equations
    \item  CMSE/CSE-822, Parallel programming (3 credits) 
    \item  CMSE-823, Numerical Linear Algebra, I (3 credits)
\end{itemize}

\item One or more additional courses, which may include further CMSE
  courses at the 400 level or above (including from the list of 
  CMSE graduate courses in List 1), courses from the list of non-CMSE
  courses  in Section~\ref{sec:courses}, or other computational
  science or data science-focused courses at the 400 level or above as
  approved by the CMSE Graduate Director (3 or more credits).

\end{enumerate}
