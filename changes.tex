\begin{itemize}

  \item Updated language in Section~\ref{sec:dual_phd}, item 6 \textbf{Dissertation
    Committee}. The update made more clear that two CMSE faculty are
    required to be part of a Dual PhD committee

  \item In Section~\ref{sec:dual_phd}, item 3 \textbf{Qualifying
    Exam}. The average of the core subject grades (course or exam) was
    changed to be a minimum of 3.25 (previously 3.5).

  \item The description of the qualifier in
    Section~\ref{sec:qual_exam} has been updated. Please read it for
    more details. The important point is that a subject course
    \textbf{grade} will be used for qualifying in a subject area. The
    subject exams will still exist (again, read it for details) but
    passing the course at an acceptable level is good enough to
    qualify in a subject.
