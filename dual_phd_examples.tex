\section{Examples of dual PhD programs of study}
\label{sec:dual_phd_examples}

This section provides examples of dual PhD programs of study
incorporating CMSE and a second subject for several of the programs
that are common partners in this endeavor.   This information is provided
as guidance for students developing a dual PhD program, and
is non-binding (i.e., it does not represent a set of
\textit{requirements}, simply a set of guidelines).  Final approval of
any dual PhD program rests with the student's dissertation
committee as well as the graduate directors of CMSE and the second PhD
program.

The requirements of the CMSE PhD program is described in
detail in Section~\ref{sec:phd}, and the Department of CMSE's
guidelines on dual PhDs with CMSE and a second
subject are described in Section~\ref{sec:dual_phd}.
