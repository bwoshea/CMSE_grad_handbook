\section{Admission requirements for MS and PhD programs}
\label{sec:grad_admission}

Students who wish to apply to either the master's or doctoral program in Computational
Mathematics, Science and Engineering should, at the time of entering
the program, have a Bachelor's degree in mathematics, statistics,
computer science, or any science or engineering field.  Beyond this
requirement, a student should have:

\begin{itemize}
\item Coursework in calculus through differential equations.

\item A course in basic linear algebra or equivalent training through
  a related course.

\item Competency in basic statistics through coursework or practical
  experience

\item Competency in at least one commonly-used programming language
  (e.g., Python, C/C++, Java, etc.)

\end{itemize}

The competitive applicant to the PhD program will also have some experience outside of
their coursework in scientific computing or data science that
demonstrates their aptitude for success in a PhD program.  This
experience could include, but is not limited to:  

\begin{itemize}
\item Undergraduate research experience with a strong computational
  component, possibly in an REU program or working directly with an
  individual faculty member at their home institution.

\item An internship at a national laboratory or company working on a
  project that has a significant computational modeling and/or data
  science focus.

\item Independent contributions to open-source programs or libraries,
  particularly with a computational modeling and/or data science
  focus.
\end{itemize}

Applications to the M.S. or PhD program in Computational Science and
Engineering must include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Official transcripts for all prior undergraduate or graduate degrees and coursework
\item A resume or CV
\item A research statement \textbf{of no more than two pages in length}
  describing:  

\begin{itemize}
  \item The applicant's prior programming, computational, and research experience;  
  \item The applicant's goals in pursuing a PhD in CMSE;  
  \item  The CMSE faculty with whom an applicant may be interested in
    pursuing their dissertation research.  
\end{itemize}

\item At least three letters of recommendation that address the applicant's past accomplishments and potential for success in pursuing independent research in computational and/or data science.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Note about the M.S. program:} At present, admission directly to the Master of Science degree is only available in exceptional circumstances.
